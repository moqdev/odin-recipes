    <h3><p>This was one of my favorite things that my grandma made...it is a comfort food for me. It is so easy, and so delicious!</p></h3>

    <p>The truth behind the humble beginnings of the sloppy Joe may never be known, whether it was a triple-decker created from
    the memory of a mayor who visited Havana or a loose meat sandwich born in a cafe in Sioux City, Iowa.</p>
    
    <p>What really matters is the place your mind goes when you pick one up, take that first bite and feel the slow trickle of
    greasy sauce down your chin. Because in the end, memories are more potent than any definitive version of history. One
    woman's Havana is another woman's Queens.</p>
