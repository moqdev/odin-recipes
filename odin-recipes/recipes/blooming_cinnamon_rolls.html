  is one roll that’s unforgettable. Make with your little chefs, and enjoy every bite together.</p></h2>

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>1 can (17.5 oz) refrigerated Pillsbury™ Grands!™ Flaky Cinnamon Rolls with Original Icing (5 Count)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
    <li>5 tablespoons caramel topping or caramel sauce</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat oven to 350°F. Line 9-inch round cake pan with cooking parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Separate dough into 5 rounds; reserve icing. Using a kitchen scissors, make cuts around the top inside swirl of each
    cinnamon roll (do not cut outer swirl of dough), about an inch apart and halfway down (not all the way to the bottom).</li>
    <li>Brush tops with melted butter; sprinkle with sugar.</li>
    <li>Bake 23 to 28 minutes or until golden brown. In small microwavable bowl, microwave icing uncovered on High 5 to 10
    seconds, stirring until thin enough to drizzle.</li>
    <li>Drizzle about 2 teaspoons of the icing on top of each cinnamon roll. Top each with 1 tablespoon of the caramel sauce,
    carefully spreading on top and into the cut grooves of hot cinnamon rolls. Serve with remaining icing.</li>
  </ol>
